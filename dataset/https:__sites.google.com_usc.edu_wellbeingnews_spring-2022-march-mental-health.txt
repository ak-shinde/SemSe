USC Student Health, Counseling and Mental Health Services."We have an understanding of mental health that ranges from self-guided, asynchronous information for students to connection with a professional to get their needs met. Our leadership team has been meeting with third-party companies to really vet the kind of services that they offer. We are talking with our peers at other universities to see their experiences with external service delivery, and we are making sure their offerings fit within what we're hoping for the students, as well as fit what the students are seeking. As we are going through that process, we are really making sure that we're making wise decisions and connections, both clinically and logistically for our student population."—Dr. Broderick Leaks, Director of Counseling and Mental Health Services, and Vice Chair, College Mental Health, Dept. of Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences, in a recent conversational update with undergraduate student leaders.Accessing ServicesMental Health Services for StudentsClinical and non-clinical services.Insurance-based TeleHealth ServicesUSC students have the option of using telehealth for mental health services, via the contract that the USC Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP, provided through Aetna) has with Array Behavioral Health Services (formerly Inpathy.)
