USC WELL-BEING COLLECTIVE
A university-wide effort to create a health promoting campus.
The USC Well-being Collective harnesses the power of Collective Impact for a variety of distinct and often siloed academic departments, administrative units, recognized student organizations and local non-profits to come together and work with the student community towards our common agenda: strengthening a campus culture driven by student wellbeing.
