UNDERSTANDING GRIEF AND LOSS
What we learn from the Stages of Grief model
Denial and Isolation
The first reaction is to deny the reality of the situation Many people rationalize overwhelming emotions It is what helps to buffer the immediate shock This is a response that carries us through the first wave of pain
Anger
Reality and its pain emerge yet we may not be ready The intense emotion is deflected from our vulnerable core redirected and expressed instead as anger
Bargaining
The normal reaction to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability is often a need to regain control– We may make a deal with God or our higher power in an attempt to postpone the inevitable This helps to protect us from the painful reality
Depression
It is helpful to focus on what we can control and let go of what we cannot Expend energy on changing your coping skills increase problem solving skills and increase support Along with feeling intense sadness we may also experience worry regret fear and uncertainty
Acceptance
This is different from feeling “good” or “ok” about the loss Most people don’t ever feel OK but we learn to accept this new reality and adjust the changes that may go along with the loss This stage comes with time is a process and as we move through the loss with coping skills and support we can achieve this stage Selfcompassion and kindness patience from others is helpful when striving for this goal

A Note on Traumatic Grief
A sudden unexpected loss may not only activate a grief response but may also trigger
a traumatic grief response
 When the death is violent such as from a homicide suicide overdose or accident a person could experience overwhelming emotions related to that loss It is important to recognize the difference between a normal grief response and a traumatic grief response
A normal grief response
has a range of emotions and behaviors The grieving person will feel sadness confusion longing or wishing things could have ended differently difficulty sleeping change in eating patterns etc as described in the previous section
Traumatic grief
is more complicated but has more conflicted feelings that can interfere with the natural grief process As the person mourns the loss they visualize the details of the traumatic event and reexperience it That becomes overwhelming to person and they push it out of their mind But this makes the grief process longer as the person goes back and forth mourning then pushing the traumatic details away The person can become stuck in processing of their grief and experience debilitating feelings of loss of safety trust and control
Not all grief is traumatic but all traumatic experiences include grief responses that are normal and natural Helping people to recognize that what they are feeling is “normal” is very helpful as the person moves through the grief process
SHAPING OUR RESPONSES
What we learn from the TraumaInformed Approach to Care—how we can shape our responses to support those impacted by trauma
A trauma informed response to grief requires a process that helps the person to rebuild a sense of
safety trust and control over their life
Using active listening skills and empathy
is a way to increase feelings of safety trust and control That means not giving advice not judging reflecting back to the person what you heard for clarity be reassuring and supportive By providing that safe place for someone to talk helps to build the sense of trust
Building safety and trust
helps the grieving person to regain some control over their feelings Giving them information about the grief process normalizing their feelings and providing resourcesreferrals gives that person the tools to make decisions which in turn increases their sense of control over their lives
Empowering them by discussing their options
and supporting their choices continues to build a sense of control
