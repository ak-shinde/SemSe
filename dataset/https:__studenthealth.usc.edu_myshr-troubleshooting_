FAQs for Testing
I am having appointment scheduling issues for COVID testing
If you are not able to view appointments for your desired timeslot try “select all locations” Frequently appointments are available at PardeeMarks when Jefferson Lot is booked
I don’t see appointments for later in the week
Check the schedule 412 hours ahead of your desired testing time Due to the volume of testing appointments times that are later in the week are not visible until closer to the datetime of testing
Do I need to test on the day I movein to campus
No you may schedule to test any time this week
Please note that at the
end of day Friday August 27
Trojan Check will require that your MySHR record has a completed test within the past week
Alternatively you may schedule and keep a sameday test to meet the requirement
What day of the week should I arrange to test
After your initial test
decide which “weekly” appointment date from TuesdayFriday
works best in your schedule Pro tip Avoid Mondays which are usually the most soughtafter day for testing
I live locally and commute to classes Am I required to test
Yes you are required to test as this affects your Trojan Check
I am an employee who takes classes am I required to test
Yes you are required to test as this affects your Trojan Check
Can I use a test from an outside facility to meet this requirement
No uploads from external testing sites are not accepted to meet the surveillance testing requirement

Traveling such as during movein increases risk an exposure to COVID19 When you may have had an exposure it is recommended to test between days 35 so that viral load can be more consistently detected
Uploading Documentation
Navigate to the “Upload Documents” section and you will see different areas for uploading
your
vaccine carddocumentation
religious or medical exemption forms
viral test results
if you have previously had COVID19 within the past 90 days and therefore should be exempted from testing see instructions below

In MySHR you need to take 2 actions
In the “Downloadable Forms” section upload your positive test result under
“COVID19 Viral Test Results”
 then
In the “Messages” section
send a secure message to the Advice Nurse
to let the medical team know you have uploaded the document Your record will be manually adjusted to reflect your 90day testing exemption
I’ve received my COVID19 vaccination from outside of USC how can I update this in my records
In MySHR in the “Upload Documents” section select the
“COVID19 Vaccine Documentation”
area and upload your completed both doses vaccine card Upload as soon as you have your first dose and again when you have the second dose You may also submit your declination form in this section if you have been offered the vaccine and decline to take it
Do I have to test with USC to fulfill the Trojan Check testing requirements
At this time yes This makes contact tracing much faster to conduct as lab results are available within 24 hours
Sample Collection and Lab Results
What is an invalid sample
This means that the sample cannot be processed bubbles in the sample food drink or other substance in the sample or other interference so the order is canceled
What does an “inconclusive” test result mean
This means that your test was not able to be read as either positive or negative Because the test was not a definitive negative you will need to retest and your Trojan Check campus access will be turned off until you receive a negative result
Saliva Collection Alternative
For patients who have medical difficulty with saliva sample collection and are experiencing unsuccessful sample collection a
nasal swab pilot program
is available with accompanying medical documentation
