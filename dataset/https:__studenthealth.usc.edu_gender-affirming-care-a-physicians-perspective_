GenderAffirming Care A Physician’s Perspective
March 31 2022
by Dr Patty Pinanong USC Student Health
Today we celebrate the resilience and success of our gender diverse trans community Through allyship the medical community would like to explore how to be a meaningful resource and source of support When people think about seeing a health care provider they may focus on an immediate issue  At Student Health this could be a tumble off a skateboard an asthma attack or other symptoms that might lead to a diagnosis and treatment Yet patients are more than a collection of their anatomical parts  As medical providers we strive to see the whole person in front of us and support their journey to take charge of their health and wellness
For students here at USC some are starting to explore their identity How do I fit in  What is my most
authentic
self  How do I
express
who I am  Do I feel
safe
being myself in the wider world  By the time a gender diverse individual reaches college they might have already used medical services or may be just beginning to consider gender affirming services such as hormone therapy or surgery  The research on trans experience tells us that creating a safe space to explore gender identity and expression is not only the best patientled care model it is of critical importance to the overall mental and physical health of an individual
Supporting gender identity in adolescence has positive benefits to overall wellbeing and mental health as gender diverse adolescents are at higher risk of anxiety depression suicide attempts and selfinjury than their cisgender counterparts In 2021 The Trevor Project did a National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health They found that transgender and nonbinary youth who had their pronouns respected and were able to change their name andor gender markers on legal documents reported lower rates of attempting suicide
The World Professional Association for Transgender Health 
WPATH
 is the leading global organization which provides researchbased recommendations on standards of care for transgender and gender nonconforming people  It is very clear that there are significant positive benefits to social mental health and genderaffirming medical care Efforts can be straightforward as respecting one’s chosen name providing appropriate gender markers on identity documents and using correct pronouns  In partnership with campus partners such as Equity Equal Opportunity and Title IX EEOTIX LGBTQ Student Center and Student Government we are working to implement those changes
Caring for transgender patients is an opportunity to really listen to our patients and provide the care that cultivates their wellbeing  This is the therapeutic alliance that we want to create with everyone who walks through our doors We also recognize the need to invest in our ability to be allies and advocates for our trans community by mobilizing our resources within USC and beyond This serves us well in caring for all patients but especially people from communities that historically experience greater barriers to accessing services This is our challenge and it inspires us to renew our commitment to honor the people who entrust us with their health care
