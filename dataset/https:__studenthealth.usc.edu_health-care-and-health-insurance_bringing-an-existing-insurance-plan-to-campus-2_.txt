Bringing an Existing Insurance Plan to Campus


If you have employer-based insurance (through a parent/guardian/spouse/partner) that meets the minimum requirements of the university, or you would like to consider a separate plan, you may opt to waive the Aetna plan through the Aetna website before the deadline (generally the third week of the semester). Make sure you consider the following factors before making your decision.

If your plan originates outside of the region: Make sure that you have coverage in Los Angeles and wherever else you plan to live during the year for routine services. Some plans limit coverage to emergency room care while you are out of the plan area.


Provider network: If the provider network is not extensive in southern California, it may be difficult for you to access key local services (such as mental health) while you are in school.


Your portion of payment responsibility: Some plans may seem attractive by offering a low premium, but require enrollees to pay a large portion of their medical costs through high deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. If your portion of payment is high, this may discourage you from seeking the care you need, especially in a timely manner.

Need help with insurance language? Check out the glossary of terms.
NEXT >>> If you are choosing to go with the USC Student Health Insurance Plan, you don’t have to do anything, you will be automatically enrolled for one year of coverage, and a charge will be included in your semesterly invoice (fall semester coverage is charged in September; spring + summer coverage is charged in January.) If you opt to use an external plan, please follow the process to submit a waiver form.
