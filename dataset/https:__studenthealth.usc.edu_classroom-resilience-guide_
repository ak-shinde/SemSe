Guide Resilience Through Challenges
During the year of COVID19 the university community and the global community experienced heightened stress and a broad range of impacts to their wellbeing the longterm mental health effects of which are difficult to predict
As we prepare for a return to inperson learning at USC we do know—from the 2020 Student Wellbeing Index Survey—that the experiences during pandemic varied greatly among students
Overall alcohol and other drugs decreased as did sexual assault Some students thrived in supportive environments at home and some students experienced multiple layers of hardship impacted by factors including
Illness and loss
of family members
Job loss and increased financial stress
Racism homophobia and transphobia
and other forms of bias
Isolation
from support network of peers
Duress
from living in a stressful or nonsupportive home environment
Providing space for students to acknowledge the impacts of the pandemic can help diffuse anxiety and manage stressors
A brief 10minute “checkin” at the beginning of class may be a helpful way of addressing the topic
creating connection between classmates understanding the collective experiences that are a reaction to hardship
and loss all while validating and normalizing mental health
This guide is intended to help faculty and staff navigate this context as we return to in person interactions with students
