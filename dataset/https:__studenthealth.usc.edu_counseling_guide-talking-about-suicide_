Let them know you care
“We are all experiencing shock and sadness about ’s death”
Listen with acceptance
—many emotions can be normal including anger grief and confusion Avoid taking these personally if directed at you or your office Validating and accepting anger is the best approach to diffusing it “Everyone’s reaction to grief is a bit different there is no right way to grieve”
Be patient
Less is more It is more about listening than what you have to say
Offer practical support
Does the student need assistance with classes or coursework
Are they eating and getting rest
Remind student to reach out to supportive family and friends
Keep these things in mind
Suicide is complex and there are almost always multiple causes
Offer hope Help is available and people get better with treatment
For privacy reasons we can’t share specific information about any student “Out of respect for the privacy of the family those questions are being addressed according to the family’s wishes Today we can focus on how you are doing and what you need”
