The Health Fee and Student Insurance


Health care and Health Insurance: What Every Student Should Know
Health care through USC Student Health (primary care, counseling, and referrals to specialist care) and health insurance (coverage for paying health care costs) work together to ensure USC students have access to high-quality providers for all their routine needs as well as illness/injury/crisis counseling care.
These pages walk the first-time user through services on campus (Engemann Student Health Center, UPC; and Eric Cohen Student Health Center, HSC), and extended services that are covered through their insurance plan.
USC Student Health Fee

The mandatory student health fee funds public health and preventative care for the student community, and underwrites the medical and mental health direct services. This semesterly fee (appears on your tuition bill) provides access to primary care (well visits and sick visits) and counseling services at USC Student Health Centers. Medical appointments and counseling appointments; health education and promotion; immunizations (additional fee may apply) and other travel-related services; on-site appointments with specialists in dermatology, nutrition, allergy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and reproductive/sexual health are also included at no additional cost.

As of spring 2020, medical and mental health counseling, skill-building workshops, and mental health outreach programs are available as TeleHealth visits to all students residing in California, under the Student Health Fee.

Are there any costs other than the student health fee? 
All medical and counseling visits at the campus health centers are included in the fee and there are no additional co-pays. Fees may apply for some lab tests, items such as crutches, and immunizations. Check the current fee list online for specific charges.
Student Health Insurance Plan

(paid through semesterly premiums to Aetna, the current USC student insurance carrier) provides financial coverage for a range of health care services (both preventative and treatment-related for health conditions, as well as emergency room or urgent care services) you may need that is provided outside of USC Student Health services.
Are there any costs other than the insurance premium that is included in the bill for the semester? 
Under the Aetna plan, prescription medications, vision care, emergency room care, hospitalizations, long-term mental health counseling (including substance abuse) are all covered at the following negotiated rates: 90% with USC designated care providers and 80% with Aetna preferred care providers. The plan also has an annual deductible and some additional co-insurance. The exact amount paid by the insurance company to the health care provider and the portion that you are expected to pay “out-of-pocket” may vary. See the glossary of terms for additional information, and the Aetna resources website for specific costs.
