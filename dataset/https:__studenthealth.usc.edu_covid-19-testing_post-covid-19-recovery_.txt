Post COVID-19 Diagnosis and Recovery


Information for patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19
For USC employees, a letter may be provided for verifying return to work from USC Student Health.
For USC students in isolation (tested positive/symptomatic) your date of return to activities will be determined by your health provider in USC Student Health. From this date, you may resume your usual activities. Current isolation period is a minimum of 5 days from onset of symptoms (the date of symptoms is Day 0); individuals may leave isolation on Day 6 if certain specific requirements are met. See quarantine and isolation chart.

Continue to practice physical distancing (stay 6 feet away from others) where possible; wear a mask when you are in public settings where other people are present.
You should NOT re-test within 90 days of your COVID-19 illness, as results for people who have recovered from previous infection may not accurately detect current infection.
Repeat infection or immunity—It is not yet clear from current data whether previous COVID-19 infection provides immunity from a repeat infection; continue to practice safe hygiene, distancing, and wearing face coverings.
Vaccination—you may receive the COVID-19 vaccine (and booster) after you have completed your isolation period; vaccination and boosters are recommended for individuals who have previously had COVID-19.
Coping with Isolation—Having to move into isolation can bring unexpected challenges. For students who are isolating without the support of family, these mental health tips may help restore a sense of normalcy.
