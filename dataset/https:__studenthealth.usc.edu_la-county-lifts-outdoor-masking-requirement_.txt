LA County Lifts Outdoor Masking Requirement




In alignment with the revised Public Health Officer order, masking is no longer required at outdoor events. University-sponsored outdoor events of all sizes no longer require masking for attendees. Masking continues to be required indoors in special environments including on USC transportation, and in all USC health care facilities including testing sites.
