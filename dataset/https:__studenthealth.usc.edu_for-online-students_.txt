For Online Degree Program Students


Student Health Fee
Online students are eligible, but not obligated, to pay the Student Health Fee. For information, please review the services and fees section of this website. Services are provided at locations on each of the USC campuses, in University Park and in Eastern Los Angeles.
Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP)
Plan provided through Aetna
All USC online degree program students who are taking six or more units are automatically enrolled in the USC Student Health Insurance Plan provided through Aetna. This is a PPO plan with medical and mental health coverage. Part-time students taking less than six units may opt to enroll in the plan if they would like to, please contact the Student Health Insurance Office for information.
Please note: the USC Student Health Insurance Plan “off-campus” premium rate applies to online degree students, which differs from the “on-campus” rate (for students enrolled in degree programs at the USC campus locations.)
The coverage plan runs on an annual contract that starts mid-August, and is billed through fall and spring tuition invoices. Spring invoices are a higher charge than fall as it also covers a portion of summer months through August.
Telehealth Mental Health Services
Telehealth option for USC students: students may also access secure videochat sessions with a provider through Inpathy, an online service provider that is contracted through the USC Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP is provided through Aetna.)
