Health Professions Program Students


As a new USC student in a health professions program, there are several health clearance requirements you must meet in order to begin your studies at USC.
You will receive a health clearance packet based on requirements of your specific academic program either via mail or email. Below are the health clearance requirements for the health professional programs at USC’s Health Sciences Campus. All requirements must be fulfilled before your first day of classes.
Health Professions Degree Programs Clearance Packet (for Occupational Therapy, Medicine, Pharmacy, Nurse Anesthesia, Physical Therapy, Physician Assistant, Dentistry (Advance), Dentistry DDS-DH, Speech-Language Pathology)
Visiting Students should complete a separate packet for their requirements.
If you have questions or have not received your health clearance packet, email studenthealth@usc.edu with program name and student ID number in the subject line.
