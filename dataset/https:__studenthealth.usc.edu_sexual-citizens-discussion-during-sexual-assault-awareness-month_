As we begin Sexual Assault Awareness Month uscsaam we are writing to invite you to a public discussion framed around the concept of “sexual citizens” The idea comes out of the most comprehensive study to date of sexual assault on campus conducted by the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation SHIFT at Columbia University Columbia professors and authors of
the groundbreaking book “Sexual Citizens Sex Power and Assault on Campus”
Jennifer S Hirsch and Shamus Khan will be on hand to share powerful insights from their work
Sexual Citizens on April 28 in Doheny Memorial Library from 200315pm
This event is presented by the Academic Senate the Office of the Provost the Division of Student Affairs and USC Student Health and is open to our campus community
The authors’ approach is steeped in empathy seeking to explain the social roots of sexual assault and their book offers a roadmap for how to address these events on university campuses  “Sexual Citizens” is available through the USC Bookstores the first 50 registered attendees will receive a complimentary copy while supplies last and through the USC Libraries We urge you to read itThroughout April we will demonstrate our heartfelt commitment to empower survivors with
activities that support their resilience hope and healing
 and we encourage our community to learn more about this topic to
increase awareness prevention and knowledge
This year many of you have been involved in the serious and thoughtful conversations about the issue of sexual assault and its impact on students From the
USC Campus Task Force Report
 which included research collected from surveys of our own
students’ experiences
 to the discussions with our
Working Group on IFC Culture Prevention and Accountability
 we have taken important steps toward reducing harm to our students and continue to move toward eliminating their impact on campus
Our work toward a diverse inclusive and equitable educational experience is an ongoing and evolutionary process and you play an important part in that progress We look forward to continuing this work together and we hope to see you on April 28 for this important event
