USC Student Health, part of Keck Medicine of USC, Earns Top Score in Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Healthcare Equality Index




USC Student Health is unique as one of a select group of college health providers to earn the coveted “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” designation 
USC Student Health, part of Keck Medicine of USC, has received an evaluation of 100 and the designation of “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 15th anniversary edition of the Healthcare Equality Index (HEI), the nation’s foremost benchmarking survey of health care facilities on policies and practices dedicated to the equitable treatment and inclusion of their LGBTQ+ patients, visitors and employees. A record 906 health care facilities actively participated in the 2022 HEI survey and 496 of those earned an “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” designation.
Keck Medicine’s three hospitals, Keck Medicine’s hospitals include Keck Hospital of USC, USC Norris Cancer Hospital and USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, a community hospital in Glendale, also earned “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” designation.
Keck Medicine of USC leadership expressed pride in the distinction. “This designation is a reflection of our health system’s dedication to providing quality health care to all LGBTQ+ patients in a safe, welcoming environment,” says Rod Hanners, CEO of Keck Medicine. “Keck Medicine has adopted numerous initiatives to support LGBTQ+ patient-centered care, and we will continue to be champions of this community.”
The new designation for USC’s college health provider—USC Student Health—further underscores the university’s commitment to serving the LGBTQ+ community. “Through our ongoing work to provide the best services and patient experience to USC students, we are proud to implement policies, training, education, and community outreach to ensure that all patients and clients feel safe, supported, and respected as they seek care,” says Dr. Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer for USC Student Health. “The lived experiences of LGBTQ+ community members may create hesitation or avoidance of medical care and mental health support, and as providers, we will continue to work to ensure that all our patients and clients feel empowered to seek the care they need and deserve.”
The HEI evaluates and scores health care facilities on detailed criteria falling under four central pillars:

Foundational Policies and Training in LGBTQ+ Patient-Centered Care;
LGBTQ+ Patient Services and Support;
Employee Benefits and Policies; and,
Patient and Community Engagement.

In the 2022 report, an impressive 496 facilities earned HRC’s “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” list for 2022 designation,receiving the maximum score in each section and earning an overall score of 100. Another 251 facilities earned the “Top Performer” designation with scores between 80 and 95 points and at least partial credit in each section. With 82% of participating facilities scoring 80 points or more, health care facilities are demonstrating concretely that they are going beyond the basics when it comes to adopting policies and practices in LGBTQ+ care.
USC Student Health is proud to have earned the designation of 2022 LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader.
