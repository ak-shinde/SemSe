Health Requirements for New Students: Entering for Spring 2022




Dear USC Students,
As you get ready for the academic year, we would like to share with you some materials that will help you adjust to campus life and meet some health and safety requirements.
Please review the new student materials as you make plans to start the academic year, and share with parents, guardians, and other members of your support network. 
Materials translated into Chinese are also available online.
We would also like to remind you to learn about health and immunization requirements for new students, including insurance and immunizations.

COVID-19 VACCINATION
COVID-19 vaccination: USC policy requires all students to be vaccinated for COVID-19 or submit a request for a medical or religious exemption. Students are required to complete uploading vaccination documentation by November 15. Students with a approved exemption will be required to complete regular surveillance testing. If you are an international student unable to obtain vaccination by this date due to shortages in your location, you may arrange to receive vaccination through USC Student Health upon arrival to the United States.

Meeting this COVID-19 safety requirement is mandatory in order to start attending classes on campus this spring semester. Online degree program students are exempt from this requirement. If you are currently outside the U.S. and unable to completed the vaccination requirement due to scarcity, please complete the Scarcity Exemption Form.


CONSENT FOR TREATMENT
After reviewing the new student requirements, please follow the instructions to log in to usc.edu/myshr, complete your consent for treatment (if you are under the age of 18, you must have a parent or guardian complete a third-party consent form), and upload your immunizations history, including completion of the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for students.

IMMUNIZATIONS
If you do not have complete records of immunizations, or have questions about accepted documents (including lab results), you may schedule a one-on-one question and answer session with immunizations (“Virtuchella”) after reviewing these materials. Please have your current documents uploaded to MySHR before your Virtuchella video visit with the immunizations nurse. The immunizations nurse team can order lab tests, or help schedule immunization appointments at USC Student Health, so that you complete your immunizations upon arrival.
It is strongly recommended that you complete as much of your immunizations, documentation uploads (or lab tests) as possible this fall, before arrival for the spring semester. You may make appointments in the USC Student Health immunizations office to complete any in-person requirements that are outstanding when you arrive to campus.
If you are arriving to campus from outside of the U.S., you may be required to have a TB test (tuberculosis test, only blood draw tests are accepted). It is recommended that you get your TB test, followed by COVID-19 vaccine on the same day (if you are not already fully vaccinated). Please note you must be 28 days past any recent immunization (MMR, varicella, COVID-19) in order to have a TB test. Your TB test and COVID-19 vaccine will be available at any time that you arrive in the U.S. Contact studenthealth@usc.edu to make arrangements.

ACCESSING SERVICES
Extensive information about student health operations, and mental health support, the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP, provided by Aetna) and the Student Health Fee is available through our online videos. Please review the information in these videos, and feel free to sign up for one-on-one question and answer sessions for insurance or general services after reviewing these materials.
If you are on long-term psychiatric medications, including stimulant medication for ADHD, please plan with your current provider to have a sufficient supply of medication(s) until you can arrange to continue your care with USC Student Health.  It may take 2-4 weeks to secure an appointment so it is important to come with access to at least one month’s supply of medication.
Note the deadline for Student Health insurance waivers and immunizations is January 28, 2022.

REQUIRED EDUCATIONAL MODULES
As part of the USC COVID-19 Safety Requirements, all USC students must complete:

“Health, Hygiene and Safety for Students” — This module is available at trojanlearn.usc.edu. The module takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and provide an overview of COVID-19 safety.

All students are expected to comply with COVID-19 safety requirements; non-compliance is a violation of USC’s community standards that may result in student conduct disciplinary measures.
As part of required educational modules for students, undergraduates must complete:

“CHRSH 01: Trojans Respect Consent” — All new undergraduate students are required to attend a live session activity, “CHRSH 01 Trojans Respect Consent.” These sessions live virtual sessions conducted by the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services office.
The schedule for booking sessions will be available under the MySHR “Workshops” tab.
