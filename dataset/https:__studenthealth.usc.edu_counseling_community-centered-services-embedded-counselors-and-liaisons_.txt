Community-Centered Services: Embedded Counselors and Liaisons


Meet the Embedded Counselors and Liaisons
As part of an effort to increase partnership with cultural and academic-based communities of students at USC, Counseling and Mental Health Services in USC Student Health have designated the following embedded counselors and liaisons for mental health outreach and development of relationships with members of the community.
Embedded counselors provide therapy services during their weekly schedules for their populations; liaisons work with program leads to develop programs that are responsive to the community’s needs. Both roles focus on community engagement, outreach, and prevention needs. Social justice, mental health, wellbeing, connectedness, and resiliency are typically the focus while increasing help seeking behaviors, decreasing stigma, and increase accessibility.
