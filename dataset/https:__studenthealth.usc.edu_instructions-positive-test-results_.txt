Instructions: Positive Test Results




[ If you have a SARS-CoV-2 positive lab result, you will automatically receive this message from Student Health ]
Your COVID-19 test is positive. This means that you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 even if you do not have symptoms and/or are up-to-date on your COVID-19 vaccines.
ACTION REQUIRED—REQUIRED FORM
By university policy, you are required to complete the “Contact Tracing Form for Persons with a Positive COVID-19 Test” form located at MySHR > Messages > New Message. If you have not completed this required form, you will NOT receive an automated prompt for antigen testing that may shorten your isolation period.
All patients—Complete the SYMPTOM DATE section.
Complete the CONTACT ON CAMPUS SECTION—ONLY IF you meet one of the criteria below.
YOU ARE A STUDENT WHO HAS BEEN ON CAMPUS
You have been on the USC campuses for classes, work, library study, campus gym use, campus shuttle service, or campus dining in the 48 hours (Day -1, and Day -2) prior to Day Zero (date of symptom onset, or test result).
YOU ARE A USC EMPLOYEE
You are a USC employee who has reported for work at a USC facility within the 48 hours (Day -1, and Day -2) prior to Day Zero (date of symptom onset, or test result).
YOU ARE A STUDENT RESIDING ON CAMPUS
You reside in one of the following on-campus residence halls:



Birnkrant
Marks Tower
Pardee Tower
New North
Parkside (A&H, IRC, Apartments)
Webb
USC Village (McCarthy, Cale/Irani, Nemirovsky/Bohnett, Cowlings/Ilium, McMorrow)



ACTION REQUIRED—CONTACT NOTIFICATION
You must notify all your close contacts for the 48 hours prior to your onset of symptoms or your test (if asymptomatic). Mass notification systems for campus may not comprehensively include all your contacts—it is important that you complete this step.
Using Day Zero (0) as the date your symptoms began, or if you are asymptomatic, the date of your positive test.

Review your contacts from 48 hours prior to that day; on Day (-1), and Day (-2).
Notify your contacts that they may be exposed, and send them the following link to instructions for possible quarantine and testing:

https://studenthealth.usc.edu/instructions-exposure-to-a-positive-individual/
Once you recover you should NOT re-test with a PCR test within 90 days of your COVID-19 illness unless you have symptoms or are exposed. PCR tests in people who have recovered from previous infection may not accurately detect current infection.
ISOLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Current public health guidance is that a full isolation period is 10 days, with a minimum of 5 days. Isolation means you cannot leave your residence (or have guests at your residence), except to seek medical care.
Day Zero (0) is your date your symptoms began, or if you are asymptomatic, the date of your positive test. Day One (1) is the first full day after Day Zero. Isolation instructions:
http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidisolation/
You may end isolation on day 6 with a negative antigen test.
You may meet requirements to end isolation earlier if the following criteria are met:

You have no fever for 24 hours (without using fever-reducing medicines).
Your symptoms are improving.
You are able to take an Antigen/NAAT/LAMP test on Day Five (5) or later, and the results are negative.

You will receive an automated message from Student Health on the morning of Day Six (6) to let you know how to book an antigen test appointment through MySHR. Antigen tests are subject to supply availability.
You are required to make a truthful assessment of your condition and complete an attestation.
During days 6-10, you must exercise additional precautions:

Wear a well-fitting surgical mask or N95 at all times both indoors and outdoors
Eat alone or outdoors. Individuals dining on campus must use “Grab and Go” options.

If you do not have a negative antigen test on or after day 5, you must isolate for at least 10 days, and for the last 24 hours of isolation, your symptoms must be significantly improved, including no fever. Once you have met the above criteria you may end isolation and return to campus on Day 11. A repeat or negative test is not needed nor recommended to end isolation after Day 10.
MEDICAL CARE
If you have any of the following conditions that would place you at higher risk to get more severely ill from COVID-19, please contact your health care provider as soon as possible:

Cancer or Prior Organ Transplant
Chronic Kidney, Lung or Liver Disease
Heart disease
Diabetes
Immunocompromised Condition
Obesity
Sickle Cell Disease
Pregnancy

If you have concerns about your symptoms or that you may need medical treatment, please contact your health care provider immediately.
