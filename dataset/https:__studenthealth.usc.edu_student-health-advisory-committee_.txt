Student Health Advisory Committee




The Student Health Advisory Committee (SHAC) provides an essential link between USC Student Health and the USC student population. SHAC represents the student body in relaying student health concerns and priorities, provides input into USC Student Health services, and promotes health on campus.
SHAC is comprised of members selected through campus partners and should include a diverse membership including undergraduate and graduate students, international students, and students from a variety of backgrounds, interests and majors. Student members will be appointed by respective student governments for a term of one year and one student member will be designated as a co-chair.
