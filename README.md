# SemSe
A Multilingual Semantic Search Application -  CSCI 544 Spring 2022

Most search engines and techniques emphasize keyword matching and optimizing exact pattern searching. At times, keyword search does not help the end-user as the document may not contain the exact search phrase but may contain its semantic equivalent.

This project focuses on enabling multilingual semantic search for documents and websites where normal browser search features fail to identify results using traditional keyword matching.
